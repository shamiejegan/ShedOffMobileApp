# Using the app 
You will be required to register an account in order to use the app. At this moment, you can enter any string into both the email and password fields, so you do not need to enter a real email address (however, do remember these credentials to log in again). There are a couple of onboarding steps that you will be taken through as part of the registration process, which will be used as information for the core functionality of the app. 

Once you have successfully registered an account, you will be automatically logged in. If you do get signed out, use the same log in details you provided to access data previously stored. Details are only stored on the device, so credentials and associated information are particular to the device you are using.
